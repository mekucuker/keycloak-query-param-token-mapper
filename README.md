# Keycloak Token Mapper

This Keycloak implementation provides a token mapper for any custom query parameter given during the authorization process.

This provider can be used in any Client Scope once deployed to Keycloak. As with scope authorization, query parameters must be given in the authorization request for security reasons. That's why the provider has been implemented to work on the authorization request.
